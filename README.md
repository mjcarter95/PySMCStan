# SMC_MC_approx_optL

## Version 1
- First commit of code from previous optL paper

## Version 2
- Added Monte-Carlo approximation of the optimal L-kernel (```SMC_OPT_MC```)
- Removed option for Gibbs-style sampling
- Removed option for manual L-kernel choice
- Added verbose option to ```SMC_BASE``` class

## Version 3
- Automatic testing in Github
- Introduced multi-modal example
- New proposals subdirectory where pre-written proposals classes will sit. All proposals will be based on Q_Base.
- SMC initializer now handles the incoming proposal type, including user-defined assuming it is based on Q_Base.
- D_dim_gauss.py uses a random walk proposal, while D_dim_gauss_mixture.py, uses a user-defined proposal.
- Changed test file to match new SMC class call.
