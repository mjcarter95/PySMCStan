def normalise_weights(logw):
    """
    Description
    -----------
    Normalise importance weights. Note that we remove the mean here
        just to avoid numerical errors in evaluating the exponential.
        We have to be careful with -inf values in the log weights
        sometimes. This can happen if we are sampling from a pdf with
        zero probability regions, for example.

    Parameters
    ----------
    logw : array of logged importance weights

    Returns
    -------
    wn : array of normalised weights
